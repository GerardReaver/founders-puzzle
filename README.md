# ðŸ§  Founder House Puzzle Solver

This project solves a logic puzzle using Python and the `python-constraint` library.

## ðŸ§© Puzzle Summary

- 8 founders must be assigned to 4 houses (2 per house).
- Founders cannot share hat color or symbol within the same house.
- Several clues restrict how specific founders can be assigned.
- This script finds all valid combinations.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

1. Install the constraint library (if you haven't yet):
   ```bash
   pip install python-constraint

- You can find the puzzle on youtube if you would like to see it yourself.  
- the youtube video is called, "Can you solve the sorting hat riddle? - Dan Katz and Alex Rosenthal"
- There apparently was more than one solution to the problem because my answers work and are correct.
